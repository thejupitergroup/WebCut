WebCut is a browser-based video editor that lets you animate text and images. The animations are done with key-frames (denoted in blue on the Timeline) and linear interpolation.

The design is meant for simple and quick projects, and not for full professional use.

# Usage

- Press `space` to pause or play the preview.
- Select layers to manipulate them (click on the Timeline or sidebar).
  - Pinch the screen or trackpad or use `shift + scroll` to enlarge or shrink text and images.
  - Drag to move text and images.
  - Use the `arrow keys` to jump between keypoints
  - backspace to remove keypoints.
- Importing
  - Drag-n-drop to import videos, images, or audio files.
  - Click the "Media..." button to add videos, images, or audio files.
  - Paste URLs to hosted media (only some domains)
- Exporting
  - Click the "Export" button.
  - Let the video preview play fully.
  - Click "Download" to save the `.webm` video.
